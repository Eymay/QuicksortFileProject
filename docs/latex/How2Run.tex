In order to successfully run, the executable of main.cpp and books.csv must be in the same directory. 
Commands that can be run are:
\begin{itemize}
\item g++ -g main.cpp
\item ./a.out
\end{itemize}
sorted\_books.csv will be created if the input file is present and thus the sorting is correct. If the sorting is wrong the output file will not be created.
